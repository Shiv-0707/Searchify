ImageMatcher

-> ImageMatcher is your GPU-powered visual search companion. Drop in an image, and it quickly surfaces the most visually similar pictures from your local dataset—no internet needed, just lightning-fast performance.

Key Features

-> Instant similarity search: Harnesses CLIP (ViT-B/32) to find top matches from your personalized image repository.

-> Compact, intuitive interface: Displays results as thumbnails with similarity scores and titles.

-> Efficient search logic: Uses precomputed embeddings for responsive matching even on large datasets.

How It Works
-> When you upload an image, CLIP generates a feature vector and compares it with your dataset’s stored embeddings. The server returns the best matches, which the interface neatly displays in real-time.

Tech Stack

-> Flask — REST-powered backend

-> CLIP (ViT-B/32) — for encoding and comparing images

-> Pandas + Pickle — for fast metadata and embedding storage

#Approach

I built ImageMatcher to feel smooth and clever, not just fast. At its heart, it leans on the CLIP model (ViT-B/32), which understands images in a way that’s similar to how humans do. I precompute embeddings for every image in your collection—so when you drop a new image in, it doesn’t need to learn anything new—it just compares.

Once your image is processed, the app calculates cosine similarity between your query and the saved embeddings. The magic happens fast: it sorts the results and returns only the closest matches to you, along with easy-to-read titles and thumbnails.

Flask is the rocket that drives this whole system. It manages uploading, similarity computation, and serving results—all wrapped neatly in JSON. The code even uses a thread lock so multiple people can use it at once without confusion.

By combining CLIP’s brainpower with pre-shared computations and Flask’s simplicity, ImageMatcher manages to feel almost instant, while still delivering smart, relevant results.
